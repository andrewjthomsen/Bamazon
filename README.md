# Bamazon

I encountered an issue with scope and a recurring error with recurssion when creating my bamazonManager.js file.
I was able to debug the file by refactoring my code to solve the scope issue and made some changes to the syntax in my query function associated with my updateProduct function. Once I resolved this issue, the error disappeared and the function ran properly as expected.
